<h2>This website is a collection of my hopes and my joys, 
    a place to document what I love and am grateful for. 
    It can be easy to overlook the little things in life 
    that we should be just as grateful for as the big things. 
    Creative expression can be such a good way, at least for me, 
    to remind myself of how lucky I am to have so many things in 
    my life that bring a smile to my face. This website takes 
    the form of an interactive journal of sorts, a way for me to 
    experiment artistically and place emphasis on the beauty I see 
    all around me. So take a moment to look around, I hope it will 
    inspire you to pause and be thankful for the present, because 
    it's pretty good.</h2>
